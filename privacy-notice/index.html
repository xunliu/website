<p>This privacy notice (“Privacy Notice”) applies to all visitors and users of the
Datastrato hosted services and websites (collectively, the “Website” or “Websites”)
and self-managed installations, which are offered by Datastrato Technology Inc
and/or any of its affiliates (“Datastrato” or “we” or “us”). Please read this
Privacy Notice carefully. By accessing or using any part of the Websites or
self-managed installations, you acknowledge you have been informed of and
consent to our practices with regard to your personal information and data.</p>
<p>Datastrato is an open source project and collaborative community, as well as a
company. This means that many portions of our Websites, including information
you voluntarily provide, will be public-facing for the open sharing of
innovative developments, ideas, and information that makes our collaborative
community so great. While we are committed to open sharing, we strive to respect
the privacy of individual community members and will minimize the information we
collect and share. If you do not want to share your information, including
personally identifiable information, with other community members and the
public, please be thoughtful as to how you interact with our Websites and what
information you provide through the Websites (for example, through creating a
public profile, project contributions, comments, and blog posts).</p>

<p>Oversight of Data Security is handled by Datastrato&#x27;s respective Data
Protection Officers. Should you wish to make modifications, deletions, or
additions to any personal data you believe to be captured by Datastrato, or if you
have any general security concerns, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:contact@datastrato.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact@datastrato.com</a>.</p>

<p>Like most website operators, Datastrato collects basic non-personally-identifying
information from Website visitors of the sort that web browsers and servers
typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We collect this
information to better understand how visitors use the Website, to improve our
Websites and experience for visitors, and to monitor the security of the
Websites. From time to time, Datastrato may publicly release
non-personally-identifying information collected from Website visitors in the
aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.</p>
<p>Datastrato also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from visitors. Datastrato does not use such
information to identify or track individual visitors, however. We collect this
information to understand how visitors use the Websites, to improve performance
and content, and to monitor the security of the Websites.</p>
<p>Datastrato may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our Websites.
For instance, Datastrato may reveal how many downloads can be attributed to a
particular software version using aggregated statistics that contain anonymous
user information only.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_vlJa" id="usage-data-information-from-self-managed-datastrato-instances">Usage Data Information from Self-managed Datastrato Instances<a href="#usage-data-information-from-self-managed-datastrato-instances" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Usage Data Information from Self-managed Datastrato Instances" title="Direct link to Usage Data Information from Self-managed Datastrato Instances">​</a></h4>
<p>Datastrato collects anonymous application usage data from each self-managed Datastrato
instance (Open Source and Enterprise Edition). It is possible to
<a href="/docs/reference/configuration#telemetry">opt out of application telemetry</a>
being transferred, and for self-managed Datastrato instances, we do not track end
users.</p>
<p>Telemetry data that is being collected include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The protocol used to interact with an instance API</li>
<li>The type of event used via this protocol</li>
<li>The time and frequency of these events</li>
<li>An anonymous identifier of the instance</li>
<li>The Class C network the telemetry data is sent from</li>

<p>Users of the Websites may choose to interact with Datastrato in ways that provide
us with their personally-identifying information. In some instances, a User ID
is generated for form and url tracking, page views, page pings and usage counts
in order to ascertain product performance and development. The amount and type
of information that Datastrato gathers depends on the nature of your interaction
with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to share. For example,
we ask visitors who use our community discourse group to provide a username and
email address. We will also collect the information you provide with us in
connection with creating an account on the Website. Profile information is
shared publicly, as well as activity under your profile. If you report a
security vulnerability to Datastrato and request public acknowledgment, then we may
publicly disclose the personal information you provided to us in connection with
the report, including your name to fulfill your request for acknowledgment. In
each case, Datastrato collects such personally-identifiable information only
insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s
interaction with or request of Datastrato. We will not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described in this Privacy
Notice.</p>
<p>Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain Website-related
activities or being able to access and use certain features and services.</p>
<p>For details about what information is collected and with whom it is shared,
please go to What Information Datastrato Collects and Why.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_vlJa" id="where-we-store-your-data">Where We Store Your Data<a href="#where-we-store-your-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where We Store Your Data" title="Direct link to Where We Store Your Data">​</a></h3>
<p>As part of the services offered to you, for example through our Website, the
information you provide to us may be transferred to and stored in countries
outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) as we use remote website server
hosts to provide the website and some aspects of our service, which may be based
outside of the EEA, or use servers based outside of the EEA - this is generally
the nature of data stored in “the Cloud”. It may also be processed by staff
operating outside the EEA who work for one of our suppliers, e.g. our website
server host, or work for us when temporarily outside of the EEA.</p>
<p>A transfer of your personal data may happen if any of our servers are located in
a country outside of the EEA or one of our service providers is located in a
country outside of the EEA. If we transfer or store your personal data outside
the EEA in this way, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your
privacy rights continue to be protected, as outlined in this privacy policy and
in accordance with the DPA and GDPR. If you use our service while you are
outside the EEA, your personal data may be transferred outside the EEA in order
to provide you with these services.</p>
<p>We do not use or disclose sensitive personal data, such as race, religion, or
political affiliations, without your explicit consent.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal data outside of our group: (a) in the event that
we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your
personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; and
(b) if Datastrato’s business is bought by a third party, in which case personal
data held by it about its customers will be one of the assets to transfer to the
buyer. However, any such transfer will only be on terms that the confidentiality
of your personal data is protected and that the terms of this privacy policy
will continue to be complied with by the recipient.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we will process, disclose or share your personal data only if
required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
necessary to comply with legal requirements or legal process served on us or the
website. By giving us your personal data, you agree to this arrangement. We will
do what we reasonably can to keep your data secure. You have the right to opt
out of our processing your personal data for marketing purposes by contacting us
at <a href="mailto:contact@datastrato.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact@datastrato.com</a>.</p>
<p>Although we try to provide protection, we cannot guarantee complete security for
your data, and you take the risk that any sending of that data turns out to be
not secure despite our efforts.</p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the
purposes we collected it for as described above in section 6, including for the
purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, and/or
for as long as we have your permission to keep it. To determine the appropriate
retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized
use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your
personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and
the applicable legal requirements. In any event, we will conduct an annual
review to ascertain whether we need to keep your personal data. Your personal
data will be deleted if we no longer need it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_vlJa" id="information-datastrato-does-not-collect">Information Datastrato Does Not Collect<a href="#information-datastrato-does-not-collect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Information Datastrato Does Not Collect" title="Direct link to Information Datastrato Does Not Collect">​</a></h3>
<p>Datastrato does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as
social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious
information. Although Datastrato does not request or intentionally collect any
sensitive personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of
information in a Datastrato instance by pushing it to us through our libraries or
API. If you store any sensitive personal information on Datastrato’s servers, you
are consenting to our storage of that information.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on the
Website. Datastrato does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of
our Website or content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have
reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close the child’s
account.</p>
<p>Other countries may have different minimum age limits. If you are below the
minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may
not use Datastrato.</p>

<p>Performance of a contract. The use of your information may be necessary to
perform the contract that you have with us. For example, if you use our Websites
to purchase Datastrato product subscriptions or services, contribute to a project,
create a profile, post and comment through our Websites, or request information
through our Websites, we will use your information to carry out our obligation
to complete and administer that contract or request.</p>
<p>Legitimate interests. We use your information for our legitimate interests, such
as to provide you with the best content through our Websites and communications
with users and the public, to improve and promote our products and services, and
for administrative, security, fraud prevention and legal purposes.</p>
<p>Consent. We may rely on your consent to use your personal information for
certain direct marketing purposes, such as sending you newsletter updates about
Datastrato products. You may withdraw your consent at any time through the
unsubscribe feature provided with each marketing email or by contacting us at
the addresses given at the end of this Privacy Notice.</p>

<p>Please note, email and IP addresses of users of a Datastrato deployment may be

when required to do so by law, or when Datastrato believes in good faith that
disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Datastrato,
third parties, or the public at large.</p>
<p>Datastrato takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized
access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information.</p>

<p>If you are a registered user of the Websites and have supplied your email
address, Datastrato may occasionally send you an email to inform you about
security, system information, new features, solicit your feedback, or send

recipients to update their email preferences and to opt out of such emails.</p>
<p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our

<p>We may use third party tracking services, but we don’t use these services to
track you individually or collect your personally identifiable-information. We
may use these services to collect information about how the Website performs and
how users navigate through and use the Website so we can monitor and improve our
content and Website performance.</p>
<p>Third party tracking services gather certain simple, non-personally identifying

provider, referring and exit pages, timestamp, and similar data about your use
of the Website. We do not link this information to any of your personal

<p>&quot;Do Not Track&quot; is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if
you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of
information about your online activity from third party tracking services.
Datastrato does not track your online browsing activity on other online services
over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on
our site beyond our basic tracking, which you may opt out of. Because we do not
share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third
party data collection for any of our users, and we do not track our users on
third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an
individual browser&#x27;s Do Not Track setting.</p>
