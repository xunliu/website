This period marked a significant intensification in global cloud market competition. To avoid vendor lock-in and improve their leverage in price negotiations, many companies began adopting a strategy of engaging multiple cloud vendors. While this approach introduced some management complexities, as indicated by third-party reports, it effectively mitigated the risks associated with reliance on a single cloud provider. The growing trend of mergers and acquisitions, along with other international business dynamics, further accelerated the adoption of multi-cloud strategies. The reality of having to deal with multi-cloud environments has become more common as a means of dealing with both complexity and scale."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As a result, future data platforms should inherently embrace multi-cloud architecture.
