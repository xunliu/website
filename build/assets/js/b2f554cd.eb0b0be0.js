They create barriers and inefficiencies by separating data into isolated systems, making it difficult to access and analyze information holistically.\\n\\nA typical data platform architecture combines several data stacks to meet different needs.\\n\\n![data silos](./data-silos.png)\\n\\nThis architecture inevitably introduces the data silos between the stacks.\\n\\nIn response, **Data Lakehouses** tried to solve this problem by introducing new open table formats to provide the abilities of data warehouse with the flexibility of data lake storage, such as AWS S3, Azure ADLS, etc. This centralized solution enabled organizations to break down data silos and achieve a comprehensive view of their data assets while retaining scalability.\\n\\nBut still, it cannot meet the requirements of modern data analytics:\\n\\n- The performance of the open table format cannot compete with some specialized data storage or formats.\\n- The challenge of a universal format to meet different data and AI scenarios is not trivial.\\n\\n## Cloud exacerbates the data silos\\n\\nCurrently, lots of companies and organizations introduce multi-regional or multi-cloud deployment for different reasons.\\n\\nWith the introduction of multi-regional or multi-cloud deployment, the problem of data silos becomes even more pronounced. It becomes challenging to maintain a unified view of the data across different regions or cloud providers.\\n\\n## From data analytics platform to data intelligence platform\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been a shift from traditional data analytics platforms to more advanced data intelligence platforms. These new platforms not only analyze data but also provide insights and recommendations for decision-making.\\n\\nThe shifting from a data analytics platform to a data intelligence platform reflects the increasing demands of metadata to train, prompt, and understand the organization.\\n\\n## Why unified metadata lake\\n\\n- With the increasing complexities of modern data architecture, plus the trends of moving towards multi-regional or multi-cloud deployments, the centralized data lake or data lakehouse house solution becomes quite a challenge.\\n- With the increasing need to shift to a data intelligence platform, the importance of complete, high-quality metadata becomes quite important.\\n\\nSo, instead of centralizing all the data into **ONE** data lake to achieve SSOT (Single Source Of Truth), we propose a new architecture called **metadata lake** to unify all the metadata across data stacks, regions, and clouds.\\n\\n## Gravitino - the unified metadata lake\\n\\nGravitino is a high-performance, geo-distributed, and federated metadata lake. It manages the metadata directly in different sources, types, and regions. It also provides users with unified metadata access for data and AI assets.\\n\\nThe goal of Gravitino is to provide the user with a unified data management and governance platform no matter where the data stored.\\n\\n![Gravitino architecture](./gravitino-architecture.png)\\n\\nGravitino aims to provide several key features:\\n\\n- SSOT (Single Source of Truth) for multi-regional data with geo-distributed architecture support.\\n- Unified Data + AI asset management for both users and engines.\\n- Security in one place, centralizes the security for different sources.\\n- Built-in data management + data access management.\\n\\n## The architecture of Gravitino\\n\\n![Gravitino model architecture](./gravitino-model-arch.png)\\n\\nGravitino model architecture\\n\\n- **Functionality Layer**: Gravitino provides a set of APIs for users to manage and govern the metadata, including standard metadata creation, update, and delete operations. In the meantime, it also provides the ability to govern the metadata in a unified way, including access control, discovery, and others.\\n- **Interface Layer**: Gravitino provides standard REST APIs as the interface layer for users. Future support includes Thrift and JDBC interfaces.\\n- **Core Object Model**: Gravitino defines a generic metadata model to represent the metadata in different sources and types and manages them in a unified way.\\n- **Connection Layer**: In the connection layer, Gravitino provides a set of connectors to connect to different metadata sources, including Apache Hive, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others. It also allows connecting and managing heterogeneous metadata other than Tabular data.\\n\\n## The key features of Gravitino\\n\\n### Unified metadata management and governance\\n\\nGravitino abstracts the unified metadata models and APIs for different kinds of metadata sources. For example, relational metadata models for tabular data, like Hive, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. File metadata model for all the unstructured data, like HDFS, S3, and others.\\n\\nBesides the unified metadata models, Gravitino also provides a unified metadata governance layer to manage the metadata in a unified way, including access control, auditing, discovery, and others.\\n\\n### Direct metadata management\\n\\nUnlike traditional metadata management systems, which need to collect the metadata actively or passively from underlying systems, Gravitino manages these systems directly. It provides a set of connectors to connect to different metadata sources, the changes in Gravitino will directly reflect in the underlying systems, and vice versa.\\n\\n### Geo-distribution support\\n\\nGravitino supports geo-distribution deployment, which means different instances of Gravitino can deploy in different regions or clouds, and they can connect to get the metadata from each other. With this, users can get a global view of metadata across the regions or clouds.\\n\\n### Multi-engine support\\n\\nGravitino supports different query engines to access the metadata. Currently, it supports [Trino](https://trino.io/), users can use Trino to query the metadata and data without needing to change the existing SQL dialects.\\n\\nIn the meantime, other query engine support is on the roadmap, including [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/), and others.\\n\\n### Data + AI asset management\\n\\nGravitino supports managing traditional tabular data as well as new AI types of data, like features, vectors, models, etc. The combination of data and AI asset management gives the organization an integrated management of data everywhere.\\n\\nThere are still several features we don\u2019t cover here, we will introduce them one by one in the follow-up blogs, please stay tuned.\\n\\n## The roadmap of Gravitino\\n\\nThe roadmap of Gravitino includes several key features and enhancements that are planned for future development. These include expanding support for additional query engines such as Apache Spark and Apache Flink, further improving the geo-distribution capabilities, and enhancing the unified metadata governance layer. Additionally, Gravitino aims to incorporate advanced features for data and AI asset management, ensuring that organizations can effectively leverage their data assets for AI model development and deployment. As Gravitino continues to evolve, it will remain focused on providing comprehensive solutions for unified metadata management and governance, catering to the diverse needs of modern data-driven enterprises.\\n\\nToday, we open-sourced Gravitino, by open-sourcing the project, we welcome collaboration and innovation from all of you. This move will not only foster a vibrant developer community but also accelerate the evolution of Gravitino, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of the data and AI area."},{"id":"tackling-data-silos","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tackling-data-silos","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-08-tackling-data-silos.mdx","title":"Tackling Data Silos - Challenges and Potential Solutions","description":"Datastrato - Tackling Data Silos - Challenges and Potential Solutions.","date":"2023-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"data silos","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-silos"},{"label":"architecture","permalink":"/blog/tags/architecture"}],"readingTime":4.515,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Mclean","title":"Community Manager","url":"https://github.com/justinmclean","email":"justin@datastrato.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/justinmclean.png","key":"justinmclean"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Tackling Data Silos - Challenges and Potential Solutions","authors":["justinmclean"],"description":"Datastrato - Tackling Data Silos - Challenges and Potential Solutions.","tags":["data silos","architecture"],"image":"/img/blog/placeholder.webp","slug":"tackling-data-silos"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Gravitino - the unified metadata lake","permalink":"/blog/gravitino-unified-metadata-lake"},"nextItem":{"title":"We Are Hiring","permalink":"/blog/we-are-hiring"}},"content":"In today\'s rapidly evolving business landscape, the issue of data silos has become increasingly complex. As organizations strive to meet diverse use cases, expand their operations across regions, and leverage multiple cloud platforms, the inevitable consequence is the fragmentation of data. We\'ll explore the reasons behind the persistence of data silos and discuss some current solutions while highlighting the need for a new data architecture to address this challenge.\\n\\n## The Inevitability of Data Silos\\n\\n- **Multiple Data Stacks** To cater to different use cases, organizations often adopt various technology stacks. Each stack may excel in a specific area, but this creates data silos, making it challenging to derive comprehensive insights.\\n- **Multiple Regions** As businesses grow, relying solely on a single region or data center becomes impractical. Distributed infrastructure across regions introduces data silos due to variations in storage and computing capabilities.\\n- **Multiple Clouds** Global business expansion often necessitates the utilization of multiple cloud platforms. Compliance requirements, cost considerations, and geographic factors lead to the adoption of different clouds, exacerbating the data silo problem.\\n- **The Complexity of Data Silo Challenges** Despite the various reasons causing data silos, their elimination remains elusive.\\n\\n## The Complexity of Data Silo Challenges\\n\\nHere are some key factors contributing to their persistence:\\n\\n- **Technological Upgrades** The continuous emergence of new compute engines and storage systems compels organizations to upgrade. However, the transition to newer technologies often introduces legacy data silos that are challenging to eliminate.\\n- **Data Growth and Computing Demands** With the exponential growth of data volumes and the increasing need for computational power, building a single data center or region capable of handling everything becomes impractical. This necessitates data distribution across multiple regions, perpetuating data silos.\\n- **Business Expansion and Compliance** Factors such as business expansion, data regulation policies, and cost considerations may require organizations to adopt multiple cloud platforms. As a result, data becomes scattered across different cloud platforms, contributing to the data silo problem.\\n\\n## Current Solutions\\n\\nWhile data silos pose significant challenges, some current solutions attempt to address the issue:\\n\\n- **Simplify Data Stacks** The trend of stack unification aims to use a single technology stack to accommodate various use cases. For instance, frameworks like Apache Spark offer support for batch processing, streaming, machine learning, and graph analytics. Similarly, new storage formats like the Lakehouse concept strive to unify data lakes and warehouses. However, complete unification remains elusive, and organizations often resort to specialized tools for different areas.\\n  -- **Mitigate Cross-Region Effects** Advanced hardware solutions can help alleviate bottlenecks between regions. Peer connections between virtual private clouds (VPCs) and dedicated cables connecting data centers can mitigate network issues. While this approach maintains consistent user behavior across regions, cost considerations and challenges like network latency persist.\\n- **Cloud Neutral Products** Some vendors offer cloud-neutral solutions that provide a consistent experience across multiple cloud platforms. While this approach lowers the learning curve when transitioning between clouds, it does not eliminate data silos entirely. Data replication across clouds and the lack of a unified view of distributed data remain unresolved challenges.\\n\\n## The Need for a New Data Architecture\\n\\nConsidering the complexity and persistence of data silos, it becomes evident that new data architecture is required to address the problem systematically.\\n\\nSuch an architecture should aim to:\\n\\n- **Integrate Diverse Data Stacks** Ideally the solution would facilitate the integration of specialized tools and technologies, allowing organizations to derive insights from diverse data sources without compromising performance or scalability.\\n- **Enable Seamless Cross-Region Data Operations** Advanced hardware and networking solutions should be complemented by efficient data management mechanisms that minimize network latency and cost, while ensuring data consistency and availability across regions.\\n- **Foster Cloud Agnosticism** A robust data architecture should empower organizations to leverage multiple cloud platforms without introducing data silos. It should provide a unified view of data distributed across different clouds, enabling seamless data replication, synchronization, and governance.\\n- **Embrace Data Federation** The new architecture should enable data federation, allowing organizations to access and analyze data from various sources and locations in a cohesive manner. This includes leveraging data virtualization techniques to create a logical layer that abstracts the complexities of underlying data silos.\\n- **Implement Data Governance and Security** A comprehensive data architecture must incorporate robust data governance and security mechanisms. This includes data classification, access controls, encryption, and auditing capabilities to ensure data integrity, privacy, and compliance with regulatory requirements.\\n- **Emphasize Data Integration and Interoperability** To tackle data silos, the new architecture should prioritize seamless data integration and interoperability. This involves adopting standardized data formats, APIs, and protocols that facilitate data exchange between different systems and platforms.\\n- **Leverage Advanced Analytics and AI** The new architecture should harness the power of advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to derive meaningful insights from the unified data. AI-driven data integration, data profiling, and anomaly detection can help organizations identify and address data silos proactively.\\n\\nThe persistent challenge of data silos requires a holistic and systematic approach to data architecture. While current solutions strive to simplify data stacks, mitigate cross-region effects, and provide cloud-neutral products, they fall short of eliminating data silos entirely. To truly tackle this complex problem, organizations need to adopt a new data architecture that provides more than current solutions. By addressing data silos at the architectural level, organizations can unlock the full potential of their data assets and gain a competitive edge in the data-driven era."},{"id":"we-are-hiring","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/we-are-hiring","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-05-we-are-hiring/index.mdx","title":"We Are Hiring","description":"Datastrato - We Are Hiring.","date":"2023-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"company","permalink":"/blog/tags/company"}],"readingTime":0.71,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Mclean","title":"Community Manager","url":"https://github.com/justinmclean","email":"justin@datastrato.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/justinmclean.png","key":"justinmclean"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"We Are Hiring","authors":["justinmclean"],"description":"Datastrato - We Are Hiring.","tags":["company"],"slug":"we-are-hiring"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Tackling Data Silos - Challenges and Potential Solutions","permalink":"/blog/tackling-data-silos"},"nextItem":{"title":"Datastrato Origin Story","permalink":"/blog/datastrato-origin-story"}},"content":"![We are hiring](./2023-12-05-we-are-hiring.png)\\n\\nDatastrato is actively recruiting Apache big data developers for fully remote positions.

Why did we start Datastrato?\\n\\nI am Junping Du, the Founder and CEO of Datastrato. My long term open source contributions to the [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) project enhanced its performance and adaptability within virtualized and cloud-based environments.\\n\\nMy cloud computing odyssey began in 2008 at VMware where I was part of the vCloud Director engineering team. This was a pioneering time in cloud services where AWS was the only option and offered basic services like S3 and EC2, without the advanced features we see today like VPCs. Over the following decade, I saw a shift in application workloads, moving from on-premise data centers to public cloud platforms.\\n\\nIn 2010, I turned my focus to data and pioneered VMware\u2019s Hadoop initiatives at a time when Cloudera was just a year old and Hortonworks hadn\'t emerged yet. During this period, \'Big Data\' was synonymous with \'Hadoop\', and AWS EMR was still in beta phase. I developed the equivalent of EMR on VMware\'s platforms like vSphere, vCloud, and CloudFoundry, which included Hadoop Virtualization Extensions (HADOOP-8468) to the Apache Hadoop community, resulting in optimal Hadoop performance in cloud settings used in many organizations today.\\n\\nMy passion eventually led me to becoming a lead contributor of Hadoop at Hortonworks in 2014. There I spearheaded the development of Hadoop YARN, a critical infrastructure component of the Hadoop stack. Over the next decade, I observed an increasing trend of data transitioning from private to public cloud environments.\\n\\nIn 2018, on the cusp of Hortonworks\' merger with Cloudera, I transitioned from Hortonworks to a top-tier global cloud vendor, tasked with developing data warehouse and data lake services from the ground up. This period marked a significant intensification in global cloud market competition. To avoid vendor lock-in and improve their leverage in price negotiations, many companies began adopting a strategy of engaging multiple cloud vendors. While this approach introduced some management complexities, as indicated by third-party reports, it effectively mitigated the risks associated with reliance on a single cloud provider. The growing trend of mergers and acquisitions, along with other international business dynamics, further accelerated the adoption of multi-cloud strategies. The reality of having to deal with multi-cloud environments has become more common as a means of dealing with both complexity and scale.\\n\\nAs a result, future data platforms should inherently embrace multi-cloud architecture. This perspective aligns with the ongoing transition of workloads and data from single-cloud environments to more diverse and integrated multi-cloud and hybrid cloud systems. Even today, there are no prominent and effective solutions, whether open source or commercial, for dealing with these environments.\\n\\nAround the same period, I engaged in a thought-provoking dialogue on data and AI innovation with two long-standing colleagues and friends, Jerry Shao and Xun Liu. Jerry, a former colleague at Hortonworks, embarked on his big data journey early at Intel and later emerged as a prominent figure in the Apache Spark community, contributing as a Spark committer and a Project Management Committee (PMC) member at Hortonworks. He is renowned for initiating the Apache Uniffle project, the first stable open-source remote shuffle service, addressing a longstanding challenge in the Spark, MapReduce, and Flink workload ecosystem.\\n\\nXun, a longstanding collaborator in the Hadoop community, has worked extensively with me on various projects, including [Apache YuniKorn](https://yunikorn.apache.org/), Submarine, and others. Today, YuniKorn stands as the de facto standard for deploying data services like Hadoop and Spark on Kubernetes (K8s), thanks to our collaborative efforts and contributions.\\n\\nDrawing from our shared experiences and insights, we swiftly reached a consensus to embark on an exciting new venture focused on multi-cloud data initiatives. This decision was grounded in our extensive backgrounds and collective wisdom as seasoned data platform engineers.\\n\\nThus, we, three Apache members (comprising two Hadoop committers and one Spark committer), decided to leave our full-time jobs to delve into the uncharted territories of the data world. Our mission is to dismantle data silos across diverse infrastructures, whether they are multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, or others.\\n\\nWe\'ve named our venture \\"Data Stratosphere,\\" drawing an analogy to the stratosphere, a layer above the clouds where jets soar for smoother travel. Our goal is to offer a similar ease to \'data pilots\', eliminating concerns about data isolation and the extra costs associated with multi-cloud adoption. At Datastrato, we aim to provide comprehensive management, governance, analytics, and acceleration for data, addressing the fundamental needs of enterprise data teams.\\n\\nIn our vision, Datastrato is more than a company; it\'s a commitment to smooth, cost-effective data management across diverse cloud infrastructures, guided by our extensive experience and dedication to innovation in the data world.\\n\\n<sub>\\n  Apache\xae, Apache Hadoop&reg;, Apache Hive&trade;, Apache Iceberg&trade;, Apache Kafka&reg;, Apache Spark&trade;,\\n  Apache Submarine&trade;, Apache Thrift&trade; and Apache Zeppelin&trade; are either registered trademarks or\\n  trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation in the United States and/or other countries.\\n</sub>"}]}')}}]);
